#### HTML Size Logic is almost as complicated as Chemistry...

After people have tried out this website, they've all shown me how everything's pretty small on their screens. That makes sense because my laptop is around 1300 pixels wide, which is kinda small. Developing for that size, others are bound to see my website at a small scale. That's why I've made it so that now the contents of the screen scale with your screen!

The canvas will always take up as much space as possible, while still being square. Try it out!!!

If you have recommendations about how to fix the small space problem, please tell! My current plan is just to add a zooming feature.

I also made a bunch of small changes, but those are just fixes and improvements to the panel on the right.

See you next time!
