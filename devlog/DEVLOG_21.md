#### Science can be confusing...

I was shown that my program DESPERATELY needs some tutorials or something, because it's very confusing to use. So I made one!

## Making the Thing

I started by making a panel that can show up from the left. It looked like this when it didn't have anything on it.

















P.S.
Turns out that the `.mkf` file format is already taken... by karaoke software. So from now on, it'll just be `.molecule`. Bummer.

Have fun not being confused, and see you next time!
