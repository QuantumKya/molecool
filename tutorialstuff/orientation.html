<p>Do you want to be precise with your atom positioning? Well I've just the tools for you...
    <br>The <b><i>Orientation Tools</i></b>!</p>

<h2>Rotate One</h2>

<p>This tool rotates an atom around another atom, retaining distance. It's good for precise angle changes.
    <br>Right click on the atom to pivot around, then on the atom to be rotated. Finally, right click to select the angle.</p>

<h2>Rotate All</h2>

<p>This tool rotates all connected atoms around a certain pivot atom. It's good for adjusting the entire atom.
    <br>Right click on the pivot atom, then on a neighboring atom. This second atom will travel to the angle you pick, dragging the others along with it.</p>

<h2>Same Distance</h2>

<p>This tool makes all of the neighbors of an atom be of the same distance away. It's good for symmetry.
    <br>Right click on the central atom, then on a neighboring atom. The rest of the neighbors will snap to be the same distance away as that neighboring atom you chose.</p>

<h2>Equally Angled</h2>

<p>This tool evenly angles all neighbors of an atom. It's good for symmetry as well.
    <br>Right click on the central atom, then on a neighboring atom. This second atom will travel to the angle you pick. Every other neighboring atom will have 1/nth of a full rotation between them, where n is the number of neighbors. In other words... equally angled.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Make sure to use the orientation tools for the best-looking molecules.</p>
