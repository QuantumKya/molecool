<p>Made a molecule and have no idea what it does, or how to call it? Use the analysis tools!
    <br>They can show you the formula, a possible name for the molecule, and check if any functional groups are in your molecule.</p>

<h2>Chemical Formula & Name</h2>

<p>Up at the top of the control panel is where your molecule's chemical formula and formulaic name are displayed.  
    <br>They change dynamically as you edit your molecule.</p>

<h2>Finding Functional Groups</h2>

<p>Antipodally, the bottom of the control panel has a button that shows you any functional groups present in your molecule.  
    <br>When you click it, your molecule will be scanned for functional groups. When it's done, it'll tell you a list of the present groups. Then, in sequence, the groups will be highighted on your molecule. The group itself will flash yellow, and the rest of the molecule (R on a functional group diagram) will flash green.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There's a lot to learn about a molecule. You can learn a couple with these features.</p>
<p>...and, now you're done with the tutorial! Happy molecule-ing!</p>
