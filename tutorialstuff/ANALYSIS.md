# Analysis
[<-- Previous Tutorial](./ORIENTATION.md)

Made a molecule and have no idea what it does, or how to call it? Use the analysis tools!  
They can show you the formula, a possible name for the molecule, and check if any functional groups are in your molecule.

### Chemical Formula & Name

Up at the top of the control panel is where your molecule's chemical formula and formulaic name are displayed.  
They change dynamically as you edit your molecule. You can click either of them to copy them to your clipboard.

### Finding Functional Groups

Antipodally, the bottom of the control panel has a button that shows you any functional groups present in your molecule.  
When you click it, your molecule will be scanned for functional groups. When it's done, it'll tell you a list of the present groups. Then, in sequence, the groups will be highighted on your molecule. The group itself will flash yellow, and the rest of the molecule (R on a functional group diagram) will flash green.
