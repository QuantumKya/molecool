Do you want to be precise with your atom positioning? Well I've just the tools for you...  
The ***Orientation Tools***!

![So Many Options!](img/so_many_options.png)

### Rotate One

This tool rotates an atom around another atom, retaining distance. It's good for precise angle changes.  
Right click on the atom to pivot around, then on the atom to be rotated. Finally, right click to select the angle.

### Rotate All

This tool rotates all connected atoms around a certain pivot atom. It's good for adjusting the entire atom.  
Right click on the pivot atom, then on a neighboring atom. This second atom will travel to the angle you pick, dragging the others along with it.

### Same Distance

This tool makes all of the neighbors of an atom be of the same distance away. It's good for symmetry.  
Right click on the central atom, then on a neighboring atom. The rest of the neighbors will snap to be the same distance away as that neighboring atom you chose.

### Equally Angled

This tool evenly angles all neighbors of an atom. It's good for symmetry as well.  
Right click on the central atom, then on a neighboring atom. This second atom will travel to the angle you pick. Every other neighboring atom will have 1/nth of a full rotation between them, where n is the number of neighbors. In other words... equally angled.

## Conclusion

Make sure to use the orientation tools for the best-looking molecules.
